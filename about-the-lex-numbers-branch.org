We need to upgrade ~MultiTerm~ to be not just ~[Text]~. And this will affect other Parser types like ~ParamText~ and ~RelationalPredicates~. 

* To begin we will need to define the next gen grammar for Natural4

* Bottom up, we will add some ~Debug.Trace~ to the system to see what's calling ~pNumAsText~ across our existing use cases and input CSV.
