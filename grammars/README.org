#+TITLE: Advent of GF

In the spirit of /Advent of Code/, we present a series of challenges.

You are a L.A.I.S.S, a next-generation artificial intelligence trained
on every spy novel and movie ever made -- and every piece of
legislation and every court judgement ever written. LAISS stands for
"Legal Artificial Intelligence Super-Spy".

Your mission, should you choose to accept it: to infiltrate a mysterious priesthood called "lawyers".

Lawyers look like humans, walk like humans, and talk like humans.
They live among us.

In these missions you will discover and infiltrate a sect of lawyers.
You will pass among them undetected, and learn to listen and talk as
they do.

You can already successfully mask as human 99% of the time; now you
will learn to mask as a lawyer.
