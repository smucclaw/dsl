#+TITLE: Day 2: Math

* Part 1

Some lawyers are proudly "bad at math": the technical term is /dyscalculia/.

They compensate with extreme prolixity: the technical term is /logorrhea/.

Those lawyers phrase simple arithmetic problems, which are most
intuitively written with standard algebraic notation, entirely with
words.

To pass as a lawyer, you must be able to decode arbitrarily long
arithmetical sentences, and compute their answers.

* Sample input

The number of shares shall be given by the sum of the original shares
and the new shares.

The value of shares shall be given by the larger of:
- the conversion price multiplied by the number of shares, and
- the purchase price multiplied by the number of shares less 20%

The conversion price shall be given by the lesser of:
- the purchase price multiplied by 90%
- the sum of two thousand with five hundred with two hundred

* Part 2

Detect syntactically ambiguous sentences: those with multiple possible parses.
