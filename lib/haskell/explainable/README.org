#+TITLE: Explainable A.I.

"Algorithms. You're talking about algorithms."

* Motivation

A regulation says: an end-user must pay tax. A legal engineer
/encodes/ the regulation in L4; and L4 /operationalizes/ the
regulation by generating software that calculates a specific amount
for a specific end-user.

Now the end-user wants to know /why/ the amount is what it is.
Our operational runtime needs to /explain/ it -- to "show the working".

Many encodings of regulations are written as /implementations/: they
quickly return the answer, but don't include an explanation of how the
answer was derived.

Implementation-orientation is common in most of
the programming world.

"Get me the JPG at this URL."

"OK, here you go: a stream of bytes. Enjoy looking at the picture!"

What's missing from that: "First I tried the URL you gave me, but I
got a 302 redirect, so I went to this other URL instead, and when I
did, it turned out that I already had that URL in my cache, so I sent
a HEAD request rather than a GET request, and the origin server
confirmed that my cache was up to date, and, I see your eyes have
glazed over."

But when it comes to money, people suddenly perk up and pay attention
and want to know every detail.

* Example

  Suppose we have a regulation:

  #+begin_quote
  If you're dead, you don't have to pay taxes.

  If you're alive, the taxes you pay are 7% of your annual income, plus 1% of your net worth.
  #+end_quote

A specific end-user comes along. The all-seeing, all-knowing state
already knows their annual income ($100,000), and their net worth
($700,000). So the state runs a simple function, and feeds it the
parameters it already knows:

#+begin_src javascript
  function taxableAmount (vivacity, annualIncome, netWorth) {
    if (vivacity == "dead") { return 0 }
    else { return (annualIncome * 0.07 + netWorth * 0.01) }
  }
#+end_src

You could imagine that bit of JS living inside a form, which allows
the end-user to play with the inputs.

That's a pretty straightforward /implementation/. But the end-user,
like an insatiable five-year-old, asks "why?"

The only answer we can give is: "your annualIncome was 100000 and your
netWorth was 700000 and you are alive, so the tax payable is $14,000".

That's unsatisfactory. What the end-user wants to hear is:

#+begin_quote
Because the income tax rate is 7%; your income was $100,000; and so the income tax component is $7,000.

Alongside that, the asset tax rate is 1%; your assets are $700,000; and so the asset tax component is $7,000.

Together, they add up to $14,000.

If you were dead, you wouldn't have to pay anything at all.

But you're alive, so you have to pay $14,000.
#+end_quote

End-users want that level of detail.

And we want to give it to them.

In Natural L4, the encoding might be:

#+begin_example
DECIDE  taxableAmount    IS  0                                   WHEN  vivacity  IS  dead
DECIDE  taxableAmount    IS  incomeTaxAmount  +  assetTaxAmount  OTHERWISE
DECIDE  incomeTaxAmount  IS  0.07  *  annualIncome
DECIDE  assetTaxAmount   IS  0.01  *  netWorth
#+end_example

It's L4's job to figure out that:
- ~vivacity~ is a Bool
- ~annualIncome~ and ~netWorth~ are numeric inputs we require from the environment, or from the user
- ~incomeTaxAmount~ and ~assetTaxAmount~ are intermediate values.

L4 should also generate enough code in some operational language to
actually perform the computation, and return $14,000.

L4 should also, for visualization purposes, return a tree of some sort, which can be drawn as a diagram. The content of the tree would be something like this:

#+begin_example
- taxableAmount
  - IF vivacity == dead
  - THEN is 0
  - ELSE is the SUM of
    - incomeTaxAmount
      - is the PRODUCT of
        - annualIncome
        - income tax rate == 0.07
    - assetTaxAmount
      - is the PRODUCT of
        - netWorth
	- asset tax rate == 0.01
#+end_example

** In Haskell MathLang

   We provide a Haskell library which implements a MathLang as an
   embedded DSL, with syntactic sugar for familiar operators.

 #+begin_src haskell
   let taxableAmount =
         "taxable amount" @|=
         getvar "vivacity"
         @|? ( ("income tax amount"  @|=  getvar "annualIncome"   |*   "income tax rate" @|. 0.07)
               |+
               ("asset tax amount"   @|=  getvar "netWorth"       |*   "asset tax rate"  @|. 0.01) )
         @|: "the dead pay no tax" @|. 0
 #+end_src

* Output: The Answer

  The above fragment is an ~Expr Float~.

  It can be compiled to runnable Haskell, and executed in ~ghci~ or at the command line.

  But wait, where do the variable values for ~annualIncome~ and ~netWorth~ come from?

  We have an ~eval~ function that takes an ~Expr Float~ and a
  ~MyState~ containing a symbol table. It returns a ~Float~. The
  symbol table is what contains the parameters for ~annualIncome =
  100,000~ and ~netWorth = 700,000~. So the ~getVar~ pulls the
  necessary values out of that symbol table, and voila.

The symbol table is segregated by type of value.
  
#+begin_src haskell
  defaultState :: MyState
  defaultState = emptyState { symtabF = Map.fromList [ ("annualIncome", "annual income" @|.  100000)
                                                     , ("netWorth",     "net worth"     @|.  700000) ]
                            , symtabP = Map.fromList [ ("vivacity",     "alive or dead" @|.. True) ]
                            }
#+end_src

  Well, I lied. That's not /actually/ the type of ~eval~. The ~MyState~
  is available as part of an ~ExplainableIO~ monad, and that monad
  gets run by the ~xplainF~ function.

But that's basically how parameters get passed into an Explainable
expression and used to calculate a result.

With those inputs, the ~xplainF~ function does arrive at the correct answer:

#+begin_src haskell
MathITE (taxableAmount) PredVar "vivacity" MathBinOp  Plus MathBinOp (income tax amount) Times MathVar annualIncome Val (income tax rate) 7.0e-2 MathBinOp (asset tax amount) Times MathVar netWorth Val (asset tax rate) 1.0e-2 Val (the dead pay no tax) 0.0
#+end_src

- val :: 14000.0

* Output: Explanation

   The whole point of this is to provide the explanation tree.

   Calculating the result is only half the job of the ~xplainF~ function.

   The other half? Verbosely outputting the execution tree.

Here's more from the ~xplainF~ function:

    #+begin_example
      ,*** if PredVar "vivacity" then MathBinOp  Plus MathBinOp (income tax amount) Times MathVar annualIncome Val (income tax rate) 7.0e-2 MathBinOp (asset tax amount) Times MathVar netWorth Val (asset tax rate) 1.0e-2 else Val (the dead pay no tax) 0.0
      ,**** True: variable expansion: vivacity vivacity
      ,***** looked up vivacity
      ,***** True: a leaf value(alive or dead)
      ,**** thus we choose the then branch
      ,**** 14000.0: which we obtain by adding
      ,***** 7000.0: which we obtain by multiplying
      ,****** 100000.0: variable expansion: annualIncome annualIncome
      ,******* variable `annualIncome` has value Val (annual income) 100000.0
      ,******* 100000.0: annual income
      ,****** by
      ,****** 7.0e-2: income tax rate
      ,***** to
      ,***** 7000.0: which we obtain by multiplying
      ,****** 700000.0: variable expansion: netWorth netWorth
      ,******* variable `netWorth` has value Val (net worth) 700000.0
      ,******* 700000.0: net worth
      ,****** by
      ,****** 1.0e-2: asset tax rate
    #+end_example

If you opened that in Org Mode, you would be able to fold and hide and
show the subtrees elegantly; here you kind of have to squint.

* Output: Transpilation to Typescript

Haskell is fine and dandy, and it runs really fast, so in future,
the next time we need to calculate taxes for 100 million people, we
can just set up 100 million ~MyState~ configurations, and call
~xplainF~ 100 million times.

But maybe we want to push the burden of doing those 100 million
computations onto the end users. To run in their browsers on their
computers.

That means we need to transpile to Javascript.

The ~dumpTypescript~ function performs code generation to construct
a load of Typescript representing the computation that was
originally an ~Expr Float~ or a ~Pred Float~ or whatever. That
computation gets transformed into a giant tree of Typescript object
constructors.

Those objects can then be instantiated and evaluated by a
Typescript MathLang runtime.
  
The generated code sets up the input as a JS object:

#+begin_src typescript
  export function setup (symtab : any) {
    const realigned = realign(symtab);
    tsm.initSymTab({ ...{ "annualIncome": 100000.0
		   ,"netWorth": 700000.0
		   ,"vivacity": true}
		   ,...realigned })
  }
#+end_src

And it sets up the actual computation as a tree of constructors:

#+begin_src typescript
  export const maxClaim = () => {
    return new tsm.Bool3 ( "taxableAmount"
                           , tsm.BoolTriOp.IfThenElse
                           , new tsm.GetVar ("vivacity")
                           , new tsm.Num2 ( "binop Plus"
                                            , tsm.NumBinOp.Add
                                            , new tsm.Num2 ( "income tax amount"
                                                             , tsm.NumBinOp.Mul
                                                             , new tsm.GetVar ("annualIncome")
                                                             , new tsm.Num0 ( "income tax rate"
                                                                              , 7.0e-2 ) )
                                            , new tsm.Num2 ( "asset tax amount"
                                                             , tsm.NumBinOp.Mul
                                                             , new tsm.GetVar ("netWorth")
                                                             , new tsm.Num0 ( "asset tax rate"
                                                                              , 1.0e-2 ) ) )
                           , new tsm.Num0 ("the dead pay no tax", 0.0) )
  }
#+end_src

Note that each of the sub-expressions has its own label. Isn't that nice?

And when /that/ runs, you get this output, which is also intended to be viewed in Org mode:

* Output: from Typescript

The format is a little different, but the idea is the same: you get an
expression, and under it, you see how that expression was arrived at.

#+begin_example
  ,** 14000
  ,***                                   14000    taxableAmount = true branch
  ,****                                   true    vivacity
  ,****                                  14000    binop Plus = sum of
  ,*****                                  7000    income tax amount = product of
  ,******                               100000    annualIncome
  ,******                                 0.07    income tax rate
  ,*****                                  7000    asset tax amount = product of
  ,******                               700000    netWorth
  ,******                                 0.01    asset tax rate

* About the Typescript evaluation runtime

The typescript version of the MathLang codebase is its own thing; the essential operators are the same, but there is some divergence when it comes to the more unusual operators like list maps and folds; if you are doing maps, filters, and folds, you need to double check that what you want actually works as intended.

It reimplements the Haskell codebase but as a bunch of Typescript classes instead.

https://github.com/smucclaw/usecases/blob/main/sect10-typescript/src/mathlang.ts

* Output: a diagram

The Typescript also generates a Graphviz Dot file showing the computation tree:

[[./doc/taxableAmount.png]]

* Semantics (Requirements)

Based on the input problems that we've seen so far we will need the following elements of a DSL to handle arithmetic calculations involving Boolean conditionals:

** organize input parameters into dictionaries or a multi-dimensional array

This lets use set up input parameters with attributes like
- citizenship :: Singapore
- date of birth :: 1955
- income :: 100,000
- number of properties :: 1

Now we can ask, does the object qualify for some entitlement benefit, and if so, what is the amount of the entitlement? Or taxation, or whatever.

** We support the semantics of basic arithmetic

These are the operators you would expect to find on a $10 desk calculator.

Binary operators, of type ~Float -> Float -> Float~

#+begin_example
+ - * /
#+end_example

We don't have logarithms or exponentiation in the current version of mathlang, but maybe we should, for calculating compound interest.

** We support Boolean logic

These are the operators programmers learn pretty early:

#+begin_example
&& || ! ==
#+end_example

Binary operators, of type ~Bool -> Bool -> Bool~

** We support arithmetic comparison

These turn numbers into bools: ~Float -> Float -> Bool~

#+begin_example
> < >= <= == !=
#+end_example

** We support foldable lists

We might to obtain the product of all the non-negative numbers in a list. So we would need to filter and then fold.

We don't have punctuation-like operators available for that, but the constructors are

#+begin_example
ListFold
PredFold
#+end_example

This is how (for numbers) you get ~maximum~, ~minimum~, ~product~, and ~sum~.

This is also how (for Bools) you get ~any~ and ~all~ over a list of Bools.

** Setting variable bindings

Some intermediate calculations are identified by names in the source laws, e.g. "residual taxable amount".

In MathLang we save those output named values to a symbol table under the ~MyState~ record.

This allows the caller to inspect intermediate workings.

** Getting variable bindings

The text above introduces ~getvar~ but it's worth repeating here for completeness -- this is how we pull values out of the "~MyState~" symbol table, which contains the input parameters used by our calculation.

** Ternary conditions

Conditional branching is available with the usual ~if ? then : else~ punctuation: ~condition @|? then @|: else~

* Syntax

** embedded DSL in Haskell

We have a variety of sugary operators. The important ones are

*** expression labels: ~@|=~

Every MathLang expression can be labeled with an explicit name. That name, and the value of the computed expression, will be returned as part of the dictionary of intermedicate calculations.

*** simple numeric values

#+begin_src haskell
"some number" @|. 42
#+end_src

*** simple boolean values

#+begin_src haskell
"i am alive" @|.. True
#+end_src

*** mathematical binary operations

#+begin_src haskell
"doubled"  @|=    "some number" @|. 42    |*   "two" @|. 2
#+end_src

#+begin_example
|+ |- |* |/
#+end_example

*** boolean binary operations

#+begin_example
|&& |||
#+end_example

*** boolean unary not

#+begin_example
@|!
#+end_example

*** arithmetic comparison

#+begin_example
(@|<)
(@|<=)
(@|>)
(@|>=)
(@|===)
(@|/==)
(@|!==)
#+end_example

*** boolean comparison

#+begin_example
(@|==) s x y = PredBin (Just s) PredEq   x y
(@|!=) s x y = PredBin (Just s) PredNeq  x y
(@|/=) s x y = PredBin (Just s) PredNeq  x y
#+end_example

** Example of Explanation

In ~Explainable.hs~ you will find a family of functions ~xplainE~, ~xplainF~, ~xplainL~ which take some Reader environment and some expression in the DSL, and return an IO of the result, the explanation, and the state that was accumulated along the way. (Also a Writer ~[String]~ which isn't actually used but it's there because we are taking advantage of ~RWST~ so we have to respect the ~W~ somehow.)

The ~xplainF~ evaluates & explains an ~Expr Float~.

The ~xplainL~ evaluates & explains an ~ExprList Float~.

The ~xplainE~ evaluates & explains an arbitrary ~Explainable~.

So any future explainable DSL should have a similar structure in which the ~Expr~ expression language can be evaluated and explained within the ~Explainable~ monad.
