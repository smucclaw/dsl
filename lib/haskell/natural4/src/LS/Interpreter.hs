The Interpreter runs after the Parser. It prepares for transpilation by organizing the ruleset and providing helper functions used by multiple XPile backends.

In future, we may be so ambitious as to attempt some type checking and type inference, and so on, here, though that may be better left to corel4 or other backends.

See also documentation at https://github.com/smucclaw/dsl/tree/tab-mustsing#interpretation-requirements

Typical usage: an XPile module is handed the output of `l4interpret`, and makes use of the values returned in the `l4i` object.

Sometimes it will access the original rules directly. It is preferable, however, that downstream transpilers should access via the Interpreter's API.

The Interpreter can thereby handle expansion and other transformations in ways that are consistent across multiple transpilers.

To view the various endpoints exposed by the Interpreter, see @org/LATEST.org@.
