The Interpreter runs after the Parser. It prepares for transpilation by organizing the ruleset and providing helper functions used by multiple XPile backends.

In future, we may be so ambitious as to attempt some type checking and type inference, and so on, here, though that may be better left to corel4.

See also documentation at https://github.com/smucclaw/dsl/tree/tab-mustsing#interpretation-requirements

Typical usage runs `l4interpret` and then makes use of the attributes returned in the `l4i` object.
