[TODO] refactoring: these should be broken out into their own (new)types and have Rule include them all.
We should take advantage of NoFieldSelectors to reduce the hazards here


The deriving Generics stuff allows us to do things like
>>> O.has (_Ctor @"Regulative") defaultHorn
False
>>> O.has (_Ctor @"Regulative") defaultReg
True

as well as extracting givens from a rule in an easy way (see the Logical English code).

See https://hackage.haskell.org/package/generic-optics-2.2.1.0/docs/Data-Generics-Sum-Constructors.html 
for an explanation of how the Generics and optics stuff works
