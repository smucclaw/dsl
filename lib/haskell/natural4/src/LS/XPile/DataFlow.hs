-- * Conceptually, a FlowNode is either a rule or a leaf/ground term referenced by a rule.
--
-- Suppose the top-level rule is:
--
--    @DECIDE happy IF warm AND sunny@
--
-- The top-level node corresponds to "happy". And there are two dependencies: @warm@ and @sunny@.
--
-- Let's say @warm@ is a ground term: we have no further information
-- about @warm@. We need a human to provide a valuation of that fact.
-- In our graph it is a leaf node.
--
-- Let's say @sunny@ is itself a rule: @sunny IF daytime AND NOT cloudy@.
--
-- And it bottoms out there: both @daytime@ and @cloudy@ are ground terms.
--
-- So our dataflow graph has:
--
-- @
--     warm    -> happy
--     sunny   -> happy
--     daytime -> sunny
--     cloudy  -> sunny
-- @
--
-- Note that we are throwing away the logic -- we have lost the "NOT" on the "cloudy".
--
-- The same idea applies to arithmetic rules: we might have @DECIDE happiness IS baselineHappiness + situationalHappiness@, where the terms are numeric-typed; the same shape of graph obtains.
--
-- Our task is to return that graph.

-- | we use RuleNames to label the nodes in the rule diagram.

-- | it is our responsibility to maintain a mapping between node label and node number for use with fgl.
type FlowMap = Map.Map FlowNode Int

-- | We don't need edge labels. In the future, if we really wanted to, we could encode the control logic into an edge label, such that NOT is a 1, AND is a 2, etc etc.

  -- if you look at Petri.hs you will see its graph construction delves deep into the logical relationship between rules.
  -- That code was written before we had the Intepreter available to analyze rules for us.
  -- So, we grab one tree of rules at a time from the RuleGraph provided by the interpreter, and dump those;
  -- then we dump the ground term leaves in those rules.
