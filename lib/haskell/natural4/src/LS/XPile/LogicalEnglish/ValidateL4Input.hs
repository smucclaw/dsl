{- | L4 rules are refined when:
* All the rules are DECIDEs / HCs
* There is exactly one HC in the clauses field -- i.e., 
  the 'ditto' / decision table syntax will be desugared in the obvious way.
  But note that we will not support the 'OTHERWISE' keyword.
* The RelationalPredicate in the head of a HC will be a RPConstraint or RPMT -- never a RPnary or RPBoolstructR RPrel 
    (even tho the HC data type currently allows for tt)
