-- | calling the output "MyState" is misleading, but this is the most general way to cover the idea that
-- a ruleset consists of more than one rule, similar to how the Vue interface gives more than one
-- element in the left nav; each of the different rules will have its own entry in the SymTab dictionary.
--
-- so, for example, if we have a single MustSing input, we would expect the output MyState dictionary symtab
-- to contain an @Expr Float@ called "must sing"

    -- the desired output of this function should be something consistent with what app/Main.hs is expecting.
    -- the most important transformations are:
    -- starting with the rules in l4i, or the slightly transformed versions available in qaHorns,
    -- we want to output a MathLang version of the input rules,
    -- named after the top-level rule entrypoints already given in qaHorns.
    -- The target output is Typescript such as is shown in sect10-typescript/src/pau.ts, which is produced by sect10-typescript/Makefile

-- intermediate generates a MyState containing something like this:
--
--  MyState { symtabF = Map.fromList [("maxClaim", ... -- snd element dumps to { return new tsm.Bool3 )] }
