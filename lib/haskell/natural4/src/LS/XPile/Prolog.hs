{-| transpiler from NaturaL4 to Prolog. This module useful as a point of
reference for L4's operational semantics. If you know Prolog, you can
understand the meaning of L4 expressions by seeing how they translate
to Prolog.

For more information see also `RelationalPredicates`.

TODO: Move the following into a README once the transpiler toolchain
is operational.

The transpiler comes in two versions: for Prolog and for sCasp.
For a generation of valid sCasp to work, some very strong assumptions
about Spreadsheet / csv files have been made, and if these 
are not respected, the compiler produces garbage without mercy and warnings:
* Each argument of a predicate has to be written in a separate CSV cell, 
  and so has the predicate itself
* However, arguments can be composite, e.g. function and arguments.
* Also comparison operators have to be written in a separate cell. 
For available comparison operators, see function showLPspecialSCasp
* Assignment of a numerical value to a variable has to be written with IS:
  var IS val   which is rendered as var #= val in sCasp
* Equating two terms (triggerin unification in sCasp / Prolog) has to be written = .
  Attention, in a spreadsheet, the symbol = has to be preceeded by a simple quote to be accepted.
  term1 = term2 is rendered as term1 = term2 in sCasp
  The tokens == and === are synonymes of = and are also rendered as term1 = term2 in sCasp
