# How to run

The BNFC grammar is just a complete toy at the moment, I will keep developing it. But I would be happy if someone else figures out a reasonable workflow how to run it outside ghci. This is my current workflow.

1. Create the files from the BNFC grammar as follows. (I have to remove the autogenerated TestTextual.hs, because stack is unhappy with module name.)
    ```
    ┌[kiwish-4.2]-(natural4/src)-[git:textual4-bnfc*]-
    └> bnfc -m -p TextuaL4 Textual4.cf && make && rm TextuaL4/TestTextual.hs
    ```

2. Open `stack ghci`. (I also did `stack build` before, not sure if necessary. Also I find that giving some argument makes it not compile hundreds of files, that's why I put `natural4`.)
    ```
    ┌[kiwish-4.2]-(natural4/src)-[git:textual4-bnfc*]-
    └> stack ghci natural4
    … whole bunch of errors
    ```

3. Ignore all errors and just load TextuaL4.MyTest.
   ```
   ghci> :l TextuaL4.MyTest
    …
    [12 of 12] Compiling TextuaL4.MyTest  ( …/MyTest.hs, interpreted )
    Ok, 12 modules loaded.
   ```

4. Try out some things with the function `main`.

    ```
    ghci> main "Drinks MEANS consumes ANY (alcoholic, non-alcoholic) beverage"
    ```
