# Resolver to choose a 'specific' stackage snapshot or a compiler version.
# A snapshot resolver dictates the compiler version and the set of packages
# to be used for project dependencies. For example:
#

resolver: lts-21.12

packages:
- .

# Dependency packages to be pulled from upstream that are not in the resolver.
# These entries can reference officially published versions as well as
# forks / in-progress versions pinned to a git hash. For example:
#
# extra-deps:
# - acme-missiles-0.3
# - git: https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack.git
#   commit: e7b331f14bcffb8367cd58fbfc8b40ec7642100a
#
extra-deps:
- ../anyall
- ../explainable

# if you are actively developing both baby-l4 and the natural4 code that uses it (import L4.*)
# you may prefer to do something like this:
# ../../../../baby-l4
# and then you would comment out this thing which can be updated less frequently as main receives pull requests.
