//,Flood & Goodenough: Contract As Automaton,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6 Sep 2021
//,"In this lesson, we explore the ""moving parts"" of a contract, as we formalize a loan agreement.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
//,We thank Mark Flood & Oliver Goodenough for authoring the paper from which this example is drawn.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
//,"Executive Summary
A lender offers a loan with interest. The borrower repays principal plus interest in two instalments.
If any events of default occur – perhaps the borrower fails to file taxes – the lender sternly warns the borrower,
who then has a few days to cure the default; if they cannot cure it, they repay the loan.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

//,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
//,"This case illustrates L4's treatment of regulative rules as state transitions.
There are no constitutive rules in this example. This case is all about regulative rules, connected up in a process workflow diagram.
We are concerned with events occurring in time, and the positions of the parties changing in response.
Without further ado, we formalize the agreement in L4 syntax.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

//,"If you are familiar with Object-Oriented Programming, you may be saying to yourself:
I see what's going on here … class loan extends class agreement with four additional
attributes, each of which is typed with a class as well.
The ""IS A"" syntax does double duty for both extends and type-of.
Presumably, some L4 standard library declares a Person class with name, address, ID, etc, attributes.
Money probably includes notions of currency, amount, and so on.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
