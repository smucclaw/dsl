//,Imagine a provision that says something like –,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
//,,"   A person who –
    (a) walks; and
    (b) (i)   eats, or
           (ii) drinks,
    must sing.",,,,,,"from Matthew Waddington

//,How do we say this in L4?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
//,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,EVERY,Person,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,WHO,walks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,AND,,eats,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,OR,drinks,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,MUST,sing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
//,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
//,"We haven't done too much violence to the original: we've moved the ""and"" and ""or"" around, added indentation, and uppercased some keywords.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
//,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
//,"Let's do more! As documents grow in complexity, it is natural to introduce defined terms:
    A Qualifying Person is a person who walks and (eats or drinks).
    Every Qualifying Person must sing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
//,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,EVERY,Person,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,WHO,,,Qualifies,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,MEANS,walks,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,AND,,eats,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,OR,drinks,,,,,,,,,,
,,MUST,sing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
//,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
//,"We've added ""folding"": in the left margin you'll see a clickable button that hides and shows the definition of ""Qualifies"", for easier reading.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
//,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
//,"Read one way, we get ""Every Person who Qualifies must sing."" This is the regulative essence of the rule.

Read another way, we get ""A Qualifying Person is one who walks and (eats or drinks)."" This is the constitutive essence of the rule.

This takes a bit of getting used to, but we trust there are no substantive objections so far.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
//,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
//,"Now we can add checkboxes! You can click on these boxes to explore how the ANDs and ORs come together, and work through particular scenarios you may have in mind.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
//,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
//,,EVERY,Person,,,,,,,//,"To watch the checkboxes light up when you click,",,,,,,
//,,WHO,FALSE,Qualifies,,,,,,//,make a copy of this spreadsheet,,,,,,
//,,,,MEANS,TRUE,walks,,,,//,by clicking File / Make a Copy.,,,,,,
//,,,,AND,FALSE,FALSE,eats,,,//,These two slashes mark a comment: the text to the right is not part of the stanza.,,,,,,
//,,,,,OR,FALSE,drinks,,,//,A rule-level checkbox at far left assesses if the rule itself is satisfied.,,,,,,
//,,MUST,sing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
//,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
//,Checkboxes are useful for all kinds of things.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
//,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
//,,EVERY,Person,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
//,TRUE,WHO,TRUE,walks,,,,,,,,,,,,,
//,,AND,,FALSE,eats,,,,,,,,,,,,
//,,,OR,TRUE,drinks,,,,,,,,,,,,
TRUE,//,MUST,TRUE,sing,,,,,,,,,,,,,
//,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
//,,What do the checkboxes mean?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
//,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
TRUE,DECIDE,The rule-level checkbox (at far left) is checked,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,WHEN,FALSE,the conditions do not hold,,,,,,,,,,,,,b,
,OR,TRUE,the conditions do hold,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,AND,TRUE,the action is satisfied,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
//,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
//,"Logically, we have ""logical implication"": the ⇒ operator.
Practically, the rule-level checkbox at far left can be read as a compliance status.
A conjunction of rule-level checkboxes, running down the page, is tantamount to a compliance report!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
